# svelte-feedback-app

This was an app built while following along with the [Svelte Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TVy6GdtNuQ).

## Running

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Navigate to http://localhost:8080

## Caveats

* The app was made using a `degit` template that is now deprecated.
* It is recommended to use `vite` instead.
* This was also used as my first exploration into `GitHub Copilot`
  * almost all code came from its suggestions
